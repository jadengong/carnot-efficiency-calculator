# üî• Carnot Efficiency Calculator

An interactive web application demonstrating the Second Law of Thermodynamics through the Carnot cycle, for my PHYC-202 physics project!

## Project Overview

This Streamlit web app helps visualize and understand:
- **Carnot Efficiency**: The theoretical maximum efficiency of any heat engine
- **Formula**: Œ∑ = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)
- **Real-World Applications**: Comparison of ideal vs actual engine efficiencies

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Features (In Progress)

- ‚úÖ Interactive temperature sliders (Kelvin/Celsius)
- ‚úÖ Real-time efficiency calculation
- ‚úÖ Real-world engine comparisons
- ‚è≥ P-V diagram visualization
- ‚è≥ Energy flow diagrams
- ‚è≥ Creator's Note section

## Physics Concept

The Carnot efficiency demonstrates why 100% efficient engines are physically impossible. 
Even an ideal engine must reject waste heat to the cold reservoir, limited by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
